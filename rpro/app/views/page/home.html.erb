<p>"We all know giving blood provides an essential lifeline to those in need, but a growing body of research demonstrates that it could have health benefits for the donor too.

Findings have shown that donating blood reduces the risk of heart attacks and even cancer.

It even burns 650 calories for every pint given.

The news could come as welcome boost to British blood banks which use an average of 7,000 units of blood every day.

It is thought that the benefits arise from lowering high iron levels.

Iron affects how thick and sticky the texture of the blood is.  High iron levels causes the blood to be thicker.Raised iron levels also accelerate the oxidisation process of cholesterol.

This can affect blood consistency and create increased friction as it travels through blood vessels.

As this increases wear and tear to the lining of arteries it could then contribute to cardiovascular disease.

Because donating blood removes some of its iron content, it may therefore have a protective benefit if done on a consistent basis by helping thin the blood.  

According to a study from the Journal of the American Medical Association, researchers found that those aged 43 to 61 had fewer heart attacks and strokes when they donated blood every six months.
